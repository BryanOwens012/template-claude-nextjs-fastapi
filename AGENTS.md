# AI Agent Instructions

This file exists as a universal entry point for AI agents working on this project.

**All development guidelines, coding standards, workflows, and best practices are documented in `CLAUDE.md`.**

## Quick Start for AI Agents

1. **Read `CLAUDE.md`** - Contains all development guidelines and best practices
2. **Read `README.md`** - Contains project overview, setup instructions, and architecture
3. **Read `docs/AGENTS_APPENDLOG.md` (last ~100 lines)** - Contains recent decisions and changes

## Why CLAUDE.md?

While this project was initially developed with Claude Code, the guidelines in `CLAUDE.md` apply universally to all AI agents. The file contains:

- Project overview and tech stack
- Code quality standards and style guidelines
- Testing and deployment workflows
- Python dependency management
- Agent collaboration patterns
- Verification checklists
- Template customization instructions

The naming is historical - feel free to follow all guidance in `CLAUDE.md` regardless of which AI system you are.
